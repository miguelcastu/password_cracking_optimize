# password_cracking_optimizer
This project aims to crack a large dataset containing various password hashes using the fewest possible John the Ripper commands. By trying different combinations and using dictionaries, we aim to crack the majority of passwords with lengths between 3 and 7.

First we create the set of random passwords from different type of hashes(sha-256, sha-3 and md5) and then we proceed to crack the hashes with the selected commands and show the results as shown in the docx.
